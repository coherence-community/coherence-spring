        <!-- Hibernate uses query caches to cache query results keyed by the SQL and parameters that yielded them.  These
             are "GeneralDataRegions" in the Hibernate second-level cache design, as opposed to "TransactionalDataRegions",
             and are therefore not subject to the more strict concurrency control and transaction isolation requirements
             of the "read-write" "cache concurrency strategy" that can be used with TransactionalDataRegions (see
             http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/4.2/manual/en-US/html/ch20.html#performance-cache).
             Therefore the near scheme is the best choice for this cache, whose entries are never updated but only inserted,
             read, and removed.  Hibernate removes query cache entries aggressively, so expiry is not necessary.  The cache
             value in a query cache is an array of identifiers of the entities in the query result set (not the entities
             themselves).  So as a precaution size limits should be used in both tiers.  Hibernate users can provide a name
             for the query result cache on a per-query basis; by convention these names should begin with "query.".
             Otherwise the name used is "org.hibernate.cache.internal.StandardQueryCache".

        <!-- Hibernate uses the update timestamps cache to cache the timestamp of its last write to each table it maps.
             There is an entry per table, which Hibernate updates each time it writes any row in the table.  Hibernate
             reads the update timestamps cache in deciding whether it can use the query cache during query processing.
             Therefore the near scheme is the best choice for this cache, offering potentially lower read latency than
             a distributed scheme, and better efficiency than a replicated scheme.  Use the "all" invalidation strategy,
             and no size limit or expiry in either tier, for this small data set which is frequently read and written
             in each client.

        <!-- Besides query caches and the update timestamps cache, all other caches in the Hibernate second-level cache
             design are "TransactionalDataRegions" used to cache entities, collections (bound to Collection-typed fields
             of entities), or "natural IDs" (more precisely, mappings of secondary entity keys to primary keys).  For
             entity caches, Hibernate uses the fully-qualified name of the entity class as the cache name by default;
             Hibernate users can override.  For collection caches, Hibernate uses the fully-qualified name of the entity
             class followed by the name of the collection-typed field (separated by a period).

             The Coherence-based implementation of the Hibernate second-level cache SPI defaults to the "read-write"
             "cache concurrency strategy" as defined by Hibernate, for maximum concurrency control and transaction
             isolation (and therefore data correctness).  Therefore the default cache scheme for all entity, collection,
             and natural id caches is a distributed scheme.

             An optimization is possible for entities or collections that can tolerate a more relaxed cache concurrency
             strategy, e.g. the nonstrict-read-write strategy or read-only strategy as defined by Hibernate (see
             https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.2/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#caching).  Namely, a near scheme
             can be used for those entity or collection caches.  Using a near scheme enables lower-latency cache reads
             for data with less strict concurrency control requirements.  Even so, the default read-write strategy and
             distributed scheme -based implementation uses Coherence EntryProcessors not pessimistic locking for concurrency
             control, for best performance even in the face of stricter concurrency and isolation requirements.

             Therefore it is highly recommended, in fact expected, that users of the Coherence-based Hibernate second-level
             cache will customize this configuration file to provide explicit cache mappings for each entity, collection,
             and non-default query cache used by the Hibernate application, specifying schemes, size limits, and expiry-delays,
             as appropriate, for each cache, given the application's domain model and concurrency / isolation requirements.
