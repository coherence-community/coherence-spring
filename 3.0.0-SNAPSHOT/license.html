otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or
portions thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications made by
that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
combination). </p>

<p>(c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective

granted: (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i) third party
modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination of
Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as
part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent
Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications
made by that Contributor. </p>

<h5>3. Distribution Obligations.</h5>

<p>3.1. Availability of Source Code.</p>

<p>Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and
that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this
License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of
the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or
otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such
Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such
Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
through a medium customarily used for software exchange.</p>

<p>3.2. Modifications.</p>

<p>The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe
Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have
sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>

<p>3.3. Required Notices.</p>

<p>You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not
remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any
descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial
Developer.</p>

<p>3.4. Application of Additional Terms.</p>

<p>You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of
this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify
the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>

<p>3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.</p>

<p>You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under
the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the
recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth
in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable
form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that
any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not
by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify
the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
terms You offer.</p>

<p>3.6. Larger Works.</p>

<p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other
code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure
the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
Software. </p>

<h5>4. Versions of the License.</h5> 

<p>4.1. New Versions.</p>

<p>Oracle Corporation is the initial license steward and may publish
revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each
version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as
provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the
right to modify this License. </p>

<p>4.2. Effect of New Versions.</p>

<p>You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of
the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make
the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent
version of the License published by the license steward. </p>

<p>4.3. Modified Versions.</p>

<p>When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license
for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version
of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any
references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the
license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear
that the license contains terms which differ from this License.</p>

<h5>5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</h5>

<p>COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED
SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN
ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR)
ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.
NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
THIS DISCLAIMER. </p>

<h5>6. TERMINATION.</h5> 

<p>6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination
of this License shall survive.</p>

<p>6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the
Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is
referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software
(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a
Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the
Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such
Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not
the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of
this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day
notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your
claim with respect to the Participant Software against such
Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement
with Participant.</p>

<p>6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all
end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted
to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.</p>

<h5>7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</h5>

<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY
PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST
PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN
IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR
DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE
EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<h5>8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</h5>

<p>The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1))
and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are
used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.
12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those
rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu
of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision
that addresses Government rights in computer software under this
License.</p>

<h5>9. MISCELLANEOUS.</h5>

<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the
Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and
venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,
with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
States export administration regulations (and the export control laws
and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or
otherwise make available any Covered Software.</p>

<h5>10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</h5>

<p>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.</p>
