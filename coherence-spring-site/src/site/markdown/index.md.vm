>   This release of the Coherence Spring Integration is designed specifically for use
>   with **Oracle Coherence 12.1.2 and above**.

<h4>Overview</h4>

The ${site-project-title} project provides mechanisms for application developers
to integrate [Oracle Coherence][COH] and [Spring][SPRING]-based applications.

In this initial release, the ${site-project-title} project introduces a new
Spring-based mechanism that Oracle Coherence may use to resolve configured
objects.   Instead of Oracle Coherence instantiating developer provided classes
itself, say for example when using the `<class-scheme>` and `<instance>` in cache
configuration files, the integration allows developers to specify how to
resolve objects using a standard Spring `BeanFactory`.

For example, rather than instructing Oracle Coherence to instantiate a
`CacheStore` implementation, developers may request that a `CacheStore` be
resolved using a `BeanFactory`.

    <cachestore-scheme>
        <class-scheme>
            <spring:bean>
               <spring:bean-name>MySpringBasedCacheStore</spring:bean-name>
            </spring:bean>
        <class-scheme>
    </cachestore-scheme>

Further information about how to use the integration is provided in the
[usage](usage.html) documentation.
