To build the Coherence Spring project you need to have the following software installed:

- http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java SE Development Kit 17].
- http://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven]

Once you have these installed building the entire source tree is as simple as executing the following shell command
(from the root of the source directory):

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean package
----

For detailed instructions, please see the main
https://github.com/coherence-community/coherence-spring/blob/main/README.adoc[README] of the Coherence Spring source
code repository.
