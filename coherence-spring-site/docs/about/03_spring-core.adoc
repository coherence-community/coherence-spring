== Core Spring Framework

Coherence Spring provides dedicated support for the core Spring Framework and all central Coherence Spring functionality
is provided by the core module.

TIP: If you are building a new Spring project from scratch, consider using Spring Boot as it provides better
auto-configuration support as well as better configuration properties support.
