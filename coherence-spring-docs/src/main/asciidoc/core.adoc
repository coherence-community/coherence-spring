include::attributes.adoc[]

This section dives into the Coherence Spring Core module. Coherence Spring Core
provides the basic support for the {spring-framework}[Spring Framework].

[[coherence-spring-introduction]]
== Getting Started

To add support for Oracle Coherence to an existing Spring Framework project, you should first add the required Spring
Coherence dependencies to your build configuration:

.Coherence Spring Dependencies
====
.Maven
[source,xml,role="primary",subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.oracle.coherence.spring</groupId>
    <artifactId>coherence-spring-core</artifactId>
    <version>{coherence-spring-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

.Gradle
[source,groovy,role="secondary",subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
implementation("com.oracle.coherence.spring:coherence-spring-core:{coherence-spring-version}")
----
====

Next you also need to add the version of Coherence that your application will be using. Coherence Spring is compatible
with both the open source Coherence CE and the commercial version of Oracle Coherence. Therefore, we don't bring in
Oracle Coherence as transitive dependency. For example, to use Coherence CE specify:

.Oracle Coherence CE Dependency
====
.Maven
[source,xml,role="primary",subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.oracle.coherence.ce</groupId>
    <artifactId>coherence</artifactId>
    <version>{coherence-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

.Gradle
[source,groovy,role="secondary",subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
implementation("com.oracle.coherence.ce:coherence:{coherence-version}")
----
====

In order to use the commercial version of Coherence:

.Commercial Oracle Coherence Dependency
====
.Maven
[source,xml,role="primary",subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.oracle.coherence</groupId>
    <artifactId>coherence</artifactId>
    <version>{commercial-coherence-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

.Gradle
[source,groovy,role="secondary",subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
implementation("com.oracle.coherence.ce:coherence:{commercial-coherence-version}")
----
====

NOTE: Coherence CE versions are available from Maven Central. The commercial versions of Coherence needs to be uploaded
into your own Maven repository.

[[coherence-spring-botstrap]]
== Bootstrapping Coherence

Coherence Spring uses the Coherence bootstrap API introduced in Coherence CE `20.12` to
configure and create Coherence instances. This means that Coherence resources in a Spring application are typically
part of a Coherence Session.

By default, Coherence will start a single Session configured to use the default Coherence configuration file. This
behavior can easily be configured using traditional Coherence using system properties or using dedicated configuration.

[[coherence-spring-botstrap-with-default-session]]
== Using the Default Session

The main building block for setting up Coherence for Spring is the `@EnableCoherence` annotation. This annotation will
import the `CoherenceSpringConfiguration` class under the covers. Therefore, you can alternatively also declare
`@Import(CoherenceSpringConfiguration.class)` instead.

In most use-cases, only a single Coherence Session is expected to be used. Therefore, without providing any further
configuration the default session is configured using the embedded default configuration file. This results in the application
joining Coherence as a cluster member (Session type `SERVER`). This is of course not the only way. Coherence Spring support
the following 3 session types:

- *SERVER* - Join as Coherence cluster member. This is the default dession type.
- *CLIENT* - Connect to Coherence as a Coherence*Extend client
- *GRPC* Connect to Coherence as gRPC client

If the application is a Coherence cluster member, or a Coherence*Extend client, then all that needs to be specified is
the Coherence configuration file name. For instance, you may for example provide an implementation of
the `AbstractSessionConfigurationBean`, to specify the type of your session and to use a custom Coherence configuration
file.

.SessionConfigurationBean
[source,java,indent=1,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
@Bean
SessionConfigurationBean sessionConfigurationBeanDefault() {
    final SessionConfigurationBean sessionConfigurationBean =
            new SessionConfigurationBean();
    sessionConfigurationBean.setType(SessionType.SERVER);
    sessionConfigurationBean.setConfig("test-coherence-config.xml");
    return sessionConfigurationBean;
}
----

If you connect as gRPC client, however, the properties change slightly and you need to specify a
`GrpcSessionConfigurationBean`:

.GrpcSessionConfigurationBean
[source,java,indent=1,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
@Bean
GrpcSessionConfigurationBean grpcSessionConfigurationBean() {
    final GrpcSessionConfigurationBean sessionConfigurationBean = new GrpcSessionConfigurationBean();
    sessionConfigurationBean.setName("sessionName");
    sessionConfigurationBean.setChannelName("grpcChanelBeanName");
    return sessionConfigurationBean;
}
----

The Channel Name property would refer to a grpcChannel bean.

[[coherence-spring-botstrap-with-multiple-session]]
== Configure Multiple Sessions

If you need to configure multiple Coherence sessions, simply define multiple `SessionConfigurationBeans`. The auto-configuration
will pick those up automatically to configure the required sessions.

NOTE: The `default` session will only exist when zero sessions are specifically configured, or the default session is
specifically configured with the default session name.

[[coherence-spring-bootstrap-session-config-properties]]
== Session Configuration Bean Properties

Depending on the session type the available properties change a bit. The following properties all to ALL session types.

**name**

The name of the session. If not set it will be set to the default session name which is an empty String.

**scopeName**

A scope name is typically used in an application where the Coherence cluster member has multiple sessions. The scope
name is used to keep the sessions separate. The scope name will be applied to the sessionâ€™s underlying
_ConfigurableCacheFactory_ and used to scope Coherence services. In this way multiple session configurations may use
identical service names, which will be kept separate using the scope. On a Coherence cluster member, each session should
have a unique scope name.

**type**

The session type of this configuration. There are three different types of sessions that can be configured:

- *server* represents storage enabled cluster member session.
- *client* represents a storage disabled cluster member or Coherence*Extend client session.
- *grpc* is a gRPC client session (see the gRPC documentation).

The type of the session affects how the bootstrap API starts the session.

**priority**

The priority specifies the order to use, when starting the session. Sessions will be started with the lowest priority
first. If this property is not specified, the property will default to `0`.

The following property applies to the `CLIENT` (Coherence*Extend) and `Server` mode, only:

**configUri**

The Coherence cache configuration URI for the session. As already mentioned, the most common configuration to set will
be the Coherence configuration file name. If not specified, the default value will be `coherence-cache-config.xml`.

The following property applies to the `GRPC` mode, only:

**channelName**

Sets the underlying gRPC channel. If not set, it will default to `localhost` and port `1408`.

**serializer**

Specifies the serializer to that shall be used, in order to serialize gRPC message payloads. If not specified,
the serializer will be the default Coherence serializer, either POF if it has been enabled with the `coherence.pof.enabled`
system property or Java serialization.

**tracingEnabled**

Specifies if client gRPC tracing should be enabled. This is `false` by default.

[[coherence-spring-dependency-injection]]
== Dependency Injection

Coherence Spring provides comprehensive support for the injection Coherence objects into your Spring beans including:
`Session`, `NamedMap`, `NamedCache`, `ContinuousQueryCache`, `ConfigurableCacheFactory`, `Cluster`.

For the most part, you can use the equivalent Coherence Spring annotation that match the annotations from Coherence's CDI
or Micronaut support.

[[coherence-spring-dependency-injection-namedmap-namedcache]]
=== Injecting NamedMap and NamedCache

Coherence `NamedMap` and `NamedCache` instances can be injected as beans in Spring applications. The mechanics of injecting
`NamedMap` or `NamedCache` beans is identical, so any use of `NamedCache` in the examples below can be replaced with `NamedMap`.
Other more specialized forms of `NamedMap` and `NamedCache` can also be injected, for example the asynchronous forms of
both classes and views.

In Spring one caveat exists regarding the injection of Map-based classes that directly inherit from `java.util.Map`
including `NamedCache` and `NamedMap` when using the `@Autowired` annotation. Instead of injecting actual instances of
Beans representing a `java.util.Collection` or `java.util.Map`, Spring will inject a collection of all the beans that
represent the specified bean type instead. As a work-around, you can use the `@Resource` annotation, but it has its own
limitations, for instance, not being usable for constructor injection.

.Example of using the @Resource annotation
[source,java]
----
    @Resource(name = COHERENCE_CACHE_BEAN_NAME)
    private NamedCache numbers;                    <1>

    @Resource(name = COHERENCE_CACHE_BEAN_NAME)
    @Name("numbers")                               <2>
    private NamedCache namedCache;
----
<1> If not specified, the name of the field will be used to determine the cache name
<2> Alternatively, you can specify the name of the cache using the `@Name` annotation

TIP: For more information, please see {spring-docs}html/core.html#beans-autowired-annotation-qualifiers[Fine-tuning
Annotation-based Autowiring with Qualifiers] in the Spring Framework reference guide.

In order to provide a better user-experience around the dependency injection of maps, Coherence Spring introduces its
own annotation. Using the `@NamedCache` annotation, you can inject any Coherence maps in any situation including constructors.

Furthermore, `@NamedCache` also gives you some added conveniences such as the ability to specify the name of the cache or
the name of the Coherence session as part of the annotation. E.g., the above example can be simplified to:

.Example of using the @NamedCache annotation
[source,java]
----
    @NamedCache
    private NamedCache numbers;                    <1>

    @NamedCache("numbers")                         <2>
    private NamedCache namedCache;
----
<1> If not specified, the name of the field will be used to determine the cache name
<2> Alternatively, you can specify the name of the cache using the `@Name` annotation

[[coherence-spring-events]]
== Events

Event driven patterns are a common way to build scalable applications and microservices. Coherence produces a number of
events that can be used by applications to respond to data changes and other actions in Coherence.

There are two types of events in Coherence:

- link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/util/MapEvent.html[MapEvents] which are subscribed to using a link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/util/MapListener.html[MapListener]
- link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/Event.html[Events], which are subscribed to using an link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/EventInterceptor.html[EventInterceptor]

Spring makes subscribing to both of these event-types much simpler using observer methods annotated with
link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/CoherenceEventListener.html[@CoherenceEventListener].

.Example of using a Coherence Event Listener
[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
void onEvent(CoherenceLifecycleEvent event) {
    // TODO: process event...
}
----

The method above receives all events of type `CoherenceLifecycleEvent` emitted during the lifetime of the application. The
actual events received can be controlled further by annotating the method or the method arguments.

NOTE: Spring `4.2` introduced
https://spring.io/blog/2015/02/11/better-application-events-in-spring-framework-4-2[Annotation-driven event listeners] as
part of its {spring-docs}/html/core.html#context-functionality-events[event support].
Coherence Spring does *NOT* directly use Spring's `ApplicationEvent` class and the corresponding `ApplicationListener`
interface. However, Coherence Spring follows that pattern conceptually in order to provide a similar user experience.

[[coherence-spring-events-mapevent-listeners]]
=== MapEvent Listeners

Listening for changes to data in Coherence is a common use case in applications. Typically, this involves creating an
implementation of a link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/util/MapListener.html[MapListener] and adding that listener to a
`NamedMap` or `NamedCache`. Using Coherence Spring makes this much simpler by just using Spring beans with suitably
annotated observer methods that will receive the respective events.

==== MapEvent Observer Methods

A link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/util/MapEvent.html[MapEvent] observer method is a method on a Spring bean that is
annotated with link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/CoherenceEventListener.html[@CoherenceEventListener].
The annotated method must have a `void` return type and must take a single method parameter of type `MapEvent`, typically
this has the generic types of the underlying map/cache key and value.

For example, assuming that there is a map/cache named `people`, with keys of type `String` and values of type `Plant`,
and the application has logic that should be executed each time a new `Plant` is inserted into the map:

.Example of listening to Inserted events
[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}event/PersonEventHandler.java[tags=!hide]
----
<1> The `PersonController` is a simple Spring bean, in this case a `Controller`.
<2> The `onNewPerson` method is annotated with `@CoherenceEventListener` making it a Coherence event listener.
<3> The `@MapName("people")` annotation specifies the name of the map to receive events from, in this case `people`.
<4> The `@Inserted` annotation specified that only `Inserted` events should be sent to this method.

The above example is still rather simple. There are a number of other annotations that provide much finer-grained control
over what events are received from where.

===== Specify the Map/Cache name

By default, a `MapEvent` observer method would receive events for all maps/caches. In practice though, this would not be
a very common use case, and typically you would want an observer method to listen to events that are for specific caches.
The Coherence Spring API contains two annotations for specifying the map name:

- link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/MapName.html[@MapName]
- link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/CacheName.html[@CacheName]

Both annotations take a single `String` value that represents the name of the map or cache that events should be received
from.

.Listening to events for all caches
[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}event/EventHandler.java[tags=all-caches]
----

The above method receives events for _all_ caches.

.Listening to events for the map named "foo"
[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}event/EventHandler.java[tags=foo-map]
----
<1> The above method receives events for the map named `foo`.

.Listening to events for the cache named "bar"
[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}event/EventHandler.java[tags=bar-cache]
----
<1> The above method receives events for the cache named `bar`.

===== Specify the Cache Service name

In the previous section we showed to restrict received events to a specific map or cache name. Events can also be restricted
to only events from a specific {oracle-coherence-docs}develop-applications/introduction-coherence-clusters.html#GUID-62A54E60-E964-4DFE-BE7F-CA7ADA93354E[cache service].
In Coherence all caches are owned by a cache service, which has a unique name. By default, a `MapEvent` observer method
would receive events for a matching cache name on _all_ services. If an applications Coherence configuration has multiple
services, the events can be restricted to just specific services using the
link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/ServiceName.html[@ServiceName] annotation.

.Listening to events for the "foo" map on all services
[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}event/EventHandler.java[tags=all-services]
----
<1> The above method receives events for the map named `foo` on _all_ cache services.

.Listening to events for the "foo" map on the "Storage" service only
[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}event/EventHandler.java[tags=storage-service]
----
<1> The above method receives events for the map named `foo` owned by the cache service named `Storage`.

.Listening to events for ALL caches on the "Storage" service
[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}event/EventHandler.java[tags=storage-service-all-caches]
----
<1> The above method receives events for _all_ caches owned by the cache service named `Storage` as there is no `@MapName` or `@CacheName` annotation.

===== Specify the Owning Session Name

In applications that use multiple `Sessions`, there may be a situation where more than one session has a map with
the same name. In those cases an observer method may need to restrict the events it receives to a specific session.
The events can be restricted to `maps` and/or `caches` in specific sessions using the
link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/SessionName.html[@SessionName] annotation.

.Listening to events for the "orders" map in ALL sessions
[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}event/EventHandler.java[tags=orders-all-sessions]
----
<1> The above method receives events for the map named `orders` in _all_ sessions.

.Listening to events for the "orders" map in the "Customer" session only
[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}event/EventHandler.java[tags=orders-customer-session]
----
<1> The above method receives events for the map named `orders` owned by the `Session` named `Customer`.

.Listening to events for ALL caches in the "Customer" session
[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}event/EventHandler.java[tags=all-caches-customer-session]
----
<1> The above method receives events for the _all_ caches owned by the `Session` named `Customer` as there is no `@MapName` or `@CacheName` annotation.

Therefore, in application with multiple sessions, events with the same name can be routed by session.

.Route events with the cache name by the name of the session
[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}event/EventHandler.java[tags=on-customer-catalog-orders]
----
<1> The `onCustomerOrders` method will receive events for the `orders` map owned by the `Session` named `Customer`.
<2> The `onCatalogOrders` method will receive events for the `orders` map owned by the `Session` named `Catalog`.

[[coherence-spring-events-mapevent-listeners-specific-events]]
==== Receive Specific Event Types

There are three types of event that a `MapEvent` observer method can receive:

- `Insert`
- `Update`
- `Delete`

By default, an observer method will receive all events for the map (or maps) it applies to. This can be controlled using
the following annotations:

- link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Inserted.html[@Inserted] - to receive `Insert` events.
- link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Updated.html[@Updated] - to receive `Update` events.
- link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Deleted.html[@Deleted] - to receive `Delete` events.

Zero or more of the above annotations can be used to annotate the `MapEvent` parameter of the observer method.

.Listen to "Insert" event for the "test" map only
[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}event/EventHandler.java[tags=on-insert-event]
----
<1> Only `Insert` events for the map `test` will be received.

.Listen to "Insert" and "Delete" events for the "test" map only
[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}event/EventHandler.java[tags=on-insert-delete-event]
----
<1> Only `Insert` and `Delete` events for the map `test` will be received.

.Listen to ALL map events for the "test" map
[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}event/EventHandler.java[tags=on-map-event-test-map]
----
All events for the map `test` will be received.

[[coherence-spring-events-mapevent-listeners-filtering-events]]
==== Filtering Events

The `MapEvents` received by an observer method can be further restricted by applying a filter. Filters are applied by
annotating the method with a <<coherence-spring-filter-binding-annotations,filter binding>> annotation, which is a link
to a factory that creates a specific instance of a link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/util/Filter.html[Filter]. Event
filters applied in this way are executed on the server, which can make receiving events more efficient for clients, as
the event will not be sent from the server at all.

Coherence Spring comes with some built in implementations, for example:

- link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/AlwaysFilter.html[@AlwaysFilter],
- link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/WhereFilter.html[@WhereFilter],

It is simple to implement custom filters as required by applications. Please refer to the
<<coherence-spring-filter-binding-annotations,Filter Binding Annotation>> section for more details.

For example, let's assume there is a map named `people` with keys of type `String` and values of type `People`, and an
observer method needs to receive events for all values where the `age` property is `18` or over. A custom filter binding
annotation could be written to create the required `Filter`. However, as the condition is very simple, the
built-in `@WhereFilter` filter binding annotation will be used in this example with a where-clause of `age >= 18`.

.Example of a Where Filter
[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}event/EventHandler.java[tags=on-map-event-with-where-filter]
----
<1> The `@WhereFilter` annotation is applied to the method.

The `onAdult` method above will receive all events emitted from the `people` map, but only for entries where the value
of the `age` property of the entry value is `>= 18`.

[[coherence-spring-events-mapevent-listeners-transforming-events]]
==== Transforming Events

In some use-cases the `MapEvent` observer method does not require the whole map or cache value to process, it might only
require one, or a few, properties of the value, or it might require some calculated value. This can be achieved by
using an event transformer to convert the values that will be received by the observer method. The transformation takes
place on the server before the event is emitted to the method. This can improve efficiency on a client in cases where
the cache value is large, but the client only requires a small part of that value because only the required values are
sent over the wire to the client.

In Coherence Spring, event values are transformed using a link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/util/ValueExtractor.html[ValueExtractor].
A `ValueExtractor` is a simple interface that takes in one value and transforms it into another value. The `ValueExtractor`
is applied to the event value. As events contain both a new and old values, the extractor is applied to both as applicable.
For `Insert` events there is only a new value, for `Update` events there will be both, a new and an old value, and for
`Delete` events, there will only be an old value. The extractor is not applied to the event key.

The `ValueExtractor` to use for a `MapEvent` observer method is indicated by annotating the method with an
<<coherence-spring-extractor-binding-annotations,extractor binding annotation>>. An extractor binding is an annotation
that is itself annotated with the meta-annotation link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/ExtractorBinding.html[@ExtractorBinding].
The extractor binding annotation is a link to a corresponding link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/ExtractorFactory.html[ExtractorFactory]
that will build an instance of a `ValueExtractor`.

For example, assuming that there is a `NamedMap` with the name `orders` that has keys of type `String` and values of type `Order`.
The `Order` class has a `customerId` property of type `String`. A `MapEvent` observer method is only interested in the
`customerId` for an order, so the built-in extractor binding annotation
link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/PropertyExtractor.html[@PropertyExtractor] can be used
to just extract the `customerId` from the event:

.Example of a Property Extractor
[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}event/EventHandler.java[tags=on-order-with-property-extractor]
----
<1> The method is annotated with `@PropertyExtractor` to indicate that a `ValueExtractor` that just extracts the `customerId`
property should be used to transform the event.
<2> The map name to receive events from is set to `orders`
<3> Note that the generic types of the `MapEvent` parameter are now `MapEvent<String, String>` instead of
`MapEvent<String, Order>` because the event values will have been transformed from an `Order` into just the `String`
`customerId`.

It is possible to apply multiple filter binding annotations to a method. In this case the extractors are combined into a
Coherence {coherence-api}com/tangosol/util/extractor/ChainedExtractor.html[ChainedExtractor], which will return the
extracted values as a `java.util.List`.

Expanding on the example above, if the `Order` class also has an `orderId` property of type `Long`, and an observer
method, only interested in `Insert` events needs both the `customerId` and `orderId`, then the method can be annotated
with a two `@PropertyExtractor` annotations:

.Example of using multiple Property Extractors
[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}event/EventHandler.java[tags=on-order-with-multiple-property-extractors]
----
<1> The method is annotated with two `@PropertyExtractor` annotations, one to extract `customerId` and one to extract `orderId`.
<2> The method parameter is annotated with `@Inserted` so that the method only receives `Insert` events.
<3> The `MapEvent` parameter not has a key of type `String` and a value of type `List<Object>`, because the values from
the multiple extractors will be returned in a `List`. We cannot use a generic value narrower than `Object`
for the list because it will contain a `String` and a `Long`.
<4> The extracted values can be obtained from the list, they will be in the same order that the annotations were applied
to the method.

[[coherence-spring-events-event-interceptors]]
=== Coherence Event Interceptors

Coherence produces many events in response to various server-side and client-side actions. For example, _Lifecycle events_
for Coherence itself, maps and cache, _Entry events_ when data in maps and caches changes, _Partition events_ for
partition lifecycle and distribution, _EntryProcessor events_ when invoked on a map or cache, etc. In a stand-alone
Coherence application these events are subscribed to using a
link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/EventInterceptor.html[EventInterceptor] implementation registered to listen
to specific event types.

The Coherence Spring API makes subscribing to these events simple, by using the same approach used for Spring Application
events, namely annotated event observer methods. A Coherence event observer method is a method annotated with
link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/CoherenceEventListener.html[@CoherenceEventListener]
that has a `void` return type, and a single parameter of the type of event to be received. The exact events received
can be further controlled by applying other annotations to the method or event parameter. The annotations applied will
vary depending on the type of the event.

==== Event Types

The different types of event that can be observed are listed below:

* link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/CoherenceLifecycleEvent.html[CoherenceLifecycleEvent] -
lifecycle events for  link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/Coherence.html[Coherence] instances
* link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/SessionLifecycleEvent.html[SessionLifecycleEvent] -
lifecycle events for link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/Session.html[Session] instances
* link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/application/LifecycleEvent.html[LifecycleEvent] -
lifecycle events for link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/ConfigurableCacheFactory.html[ConfigurableCacheFactory] instances
* link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/cache/CacheLifecycleEvent.html[CacheLifecycleEvent] -
lifecycle events for link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/NamedMap.html[NamedMap] and link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/NamedCache.html[NamedCache] instances
* link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/cache/EntryEvent.html[EntryEvent] - events emitted by the
mutation of entries in a link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/NamedMap.html[NamedMap]
or link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/NamedCache.html[NamedCache]
* link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/cache/EntryProcessorEvent.html[EntryProcessorEvent] - events emitted
by the invocation of an link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/util/EntryProcessor.html[EntryProcessor] on entries in a
link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/NamedMap.html[NamedMap] or link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/NamedCache.html[NamedCache]
* link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/TransactionEvent.html[TransactionEvent] - events pertaining to
all mutations performed within the context of a single request in a partition of a
link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/NamedMap.html[NamedMap] or link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/NamedCache.html[NamedCache],
also referred to as "partition level transactions".
* link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/TransferEvent.html[TransferEvent] - captures information
concerning the transfer of a partition for a storage enabled member.
* link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/UnsolicitedCommitEvent.html[UnsolicitedCommitEvent] - captures
changes pertaining to all observed mutations performed against caches that were not directly caused (solicited) by the
partitioned service. These events may be due to changes made internally by the backing map, such as eviction, or referrers
of the backing map causing changes.
* If using commercial versions of Coherence with Coherence Spring, there are also events associated to
the federation of data between different clusters.

Most of the events above only apply to storage enabled cluster members. For example, an `EntryEvent` will only be
emitted for mutations of an entry on the storage enabled cluster member that owns that entry. Lifecycle events on the
other hand, may be emitted on all members, such as `CacheLifecycle` event that may be emitted on any member when a cache
is created, truncated, or destroyed.

==== Coherence Lifecycle Events

link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/application/LifecycleEvent.html[LifecycleEvent] are emitted to indicate the lifecycle of a link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/ConfigurableCacheFactory.html[ConfigurableCacheFactory] instance.

To subscribe to `LifecycleEvent` simply create a Spring bean with a listener method that is annotated with
link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/CoherenceEventListener.html[@CoherenceEventListener].
The method should have a single parameter of type `LifecycleEvent`.

`LifecycleEvent` are emitted by `ConfigurableCacheFactory` instances and will only be received in the same JVM, which could be a cluster member or a client.

For example, the `onEvent` method below will receive lifecycle events for all `ConfigurableCacheFactory` instances in the current application:

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(LifecycleEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

===== Receive Specific LifecycleEvent Types

There are four different types of `LifecycleEvent`.
By adding the corresponding annotation to the method parameter the method will only receive the specified events.

* *Activating* - a `ConfigurableCacheFactory` instance is about to be activated, use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Activating.html[@Activating] annotation
* *Activated* - a `ConfigurableCacheFactory` instance has been activated, use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Activated.html[@Activated] annotation
* *Disposing* - a `ConfigurableCacheFactory` instance is about to be disposed, use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Disposing.html[@Disposing] annotation

For example, the method below will only receive `Activated` and `Disposing` events.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@Activated @Disposing LifecycleEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

===== Receive CoherenceLifecycleEvents for a Specific Coherence Instance

Each `Coherence` instance in an application has a unique name. The observer method can be annotated to only receive events associated with a specific `Coherence` instance by using the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/Name.html[@Name] annotation.

For example, the method below will only receive events for the `Coherence` instance named `customers`:

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@Name("customers") CoherenceLifecycleEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

The method in this example will receive events for the default `Coherence` instance:
[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@Name(Coherence.DEFAULT_NAME) CoherenceLifecycleEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

==== Session Lifecycle Events

link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/SessionLifecycleEvent.html[SessionLifecycleEvents] are emitted to indicate
the lifecycle event of a link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/Session.html[Session] instance.

To subscribe to `SessionLifecycleEvents` simply create a Spring bean with a listener method annotated with
link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/CoherenceEventListener.html[@CoherenceEventListener].
The method should have a single parameter of type `SessionLifecycleEvent`.

`SessionLifecycleEvents` are emitted by `Session` instances and will only be received in the same JVM, which could be a cluster member or a client.

For example, the `onEvent` method below will receive lifecycle events for all `Session` instances in the current application:

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(SessionLifecycleEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

===== Receive Specific SessionLifecycleEvent Types

There are four different types of `SessionLifecycleEvent`.
By adding the corresponding annotation to the method parameter the method will only receive the specified events.

* *Stopped* - a `Coherence` instance has stopped, use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Stopped.html[@Stopped] annotation

For example, the method below will only receive `Started` and `Stopped` events.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@Started @Stopped SessionLifecycleEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}

Each `Session` instance in an application has a name. The observer method can be annotated to only receive events
associated with a specific `Session` instance by using the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/Name.html[@Name] annotation.

For example, the method below will only receive events for the `Session` instance named `customers`:

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@Name("customers") SessionLifecycleEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

The method in this example will receive events for the default `Coherence` instance:
[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@Name(Coherence.DEFAULT_NAME) SessionLifecycleEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

==== ConfigurableCacheFactory Lifecycle Events

link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/CoherenceLifecycleEvent.html[CoherenceLifecycleEvents] are emitted to
indicate the lifecycle of a link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/Coherence.html[Coherence] instance.

@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@Started @Stopped CoherenceLifecycleEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

===== Receive CoherenceLifecycleEvents for a Specific Coherence Instance

Each `Coherence` instance in an application has a unique name. The observer method can be annotated to only receive events associated with a specific `Coherence` instance by using the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/Name.html[@Name] annotation.

For example, the method below will only receive events for the `Coherence` instance named `customers`:

The method in this example will receive events for the default `Coherence` instance:
[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@Name(Coherence.DEFAULT_NAME) CoherenceLifecycleEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

==== Cache Lifecycle Events

link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/cache/CacheLifecycleEvent.html[CacheLifecycleEvent] are emitted to indicate the lifecycle of a cache instance.

To subscribe to `CacheLifecycleEvent` simply create a Spring bean with a listener method annotated with link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/CoherenceEventListener.html[@CoherenceEventListener].
The method should have a single parameter of type `CacheLifecycleEvent`.

For example, the `onEvent` method below will receive lifecycle events for all caches.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(CacheLifecycleEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

===== Receive Specific CacheLifecycleEvent Types

There are three types of `CacheLifecycleEvent:

* *Created* - a cache instance has been created, use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Created.html[@Created] annotation
* *Truncated* - a cache instance has been truncated (all data was removed), use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Truncated.html[@Truncated] annotation
* *Destroyed* - a cache has been destroyed (destroy is a cluster wide operation, so the cache is destroyed on all members of the cluster and clients) use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Destroyed.html[@Destroyed] annotation

For example, the method below will only receive `Created` and `Destroyed` events for all caches.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@Created @Destroyed CacheLifecycleEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

===== Receive CacheLifecycleEvents for a Specific NamedMap or NamedCache

To only receive events for a specific `NamedMap` annotate the method parameter with the
link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/MapName.html[@MapName] annotation.
To only receive events for a specific `NamedCache` annotate the method parameter with the
link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/CacheName.html[@CacheName] annotation.

The `@MapName` and `@CacheName` annotations are actually interchangeable so use whichever reads better for your application code, i.e. if your code is dealing with `NamedMap` used `@MapName`. At the storage level, where the events are generated a `NamedMap` and `NamedCache` are the same.

The method below will only receive events for the map named `orders`:

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@MapName("orders") CacheLifecycleEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

===== Receive CacheLifecycleEvents from a Specific Cache Service

Caches are owned by a Cache Service, it is possible to restrict events received by a method to only those related to caches owned by a specific service by annotating the method parameter with the
link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/ServiceName.html[@ServiceName] annotation.

The method below will only receive events for the caches owned by the service named `StorageService`:

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@ServiceName("StorageService") CacheLifecycleEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

===== Receive CacheLifecycleEvents from a Specific Session

A typical use case is to obtain `NamedCache` and `NamedMap` instances from a `Session`. It is possible to restrict events received by a method to only those related to caches owned by a specific `Session` by annotating the method parameter with the
link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/SessionName.html[@SessionName] annotation.

The method below will only receive events for the caches owned by the `Session` named `BackEnd`:

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@SessionName("BackEnd") CacheLifecycleEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

==== Entry Events

An link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/cache/EntryProcessorEvent.html[EntryProcessorEvent] is emitted when a link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/util/EntryProcessor.html[EntryProcessor] is invoked on a cache. These events are only emitted on the storage enabled member that is the primary owner of the entry that the `EntryProcessor` is invoked on.

To subscribe to `EntryProcessorEvent` simply create a Spring bean with a listener method annotated with link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/CoherenceEventListener.html[@CoherenceEventListener].
The method should have a single parameter of type `EntryProcessorEvent`.

For example, the `onEvent` method below will receive entry events for all caches.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(EntryProcessorEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

===== Receive Specific EntryProcessorEvent Types

There are a number of different `EntryProcessorEvent` types.

* *Inserting* - an entry is being inserted into a cache, use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Inserting.html[@Inserting] annotation
* *Inserted* - an entry has been inserted into a cache, use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Inserted.html[@Inserted] annotation
* *Updating* - an entry is being updated in a cache, use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Updating.html[@Updating] annotation
* *Updated* - an entry has been updated in a cache, use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Updated.html[@Updated] annotation
* *Deleting* - an entry is being deleted from a cache, use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Deleting.html[@Deleting] annotation
* *Deleted* - an entry has been deleted from a cache, use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Deleted.html[@Deleted] annotation

To restrict the `EntryProcessorEvent` types received by a method apply one or more of the annotations above to the method parameter. For example, the method below will receive `Inserted` and `Deleted` events.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@Inserted @Deleted EntryProcessorEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

[NOTE]
====
The event types fall into two categories, pre-events (those name *ing) and post-events, those named *ed). Pre-events are emitted synchronously before the entry is mutated. Post-events are emitted asynchronously after the entry has been mutated.

As pre-events are synchronous the listener method should not take a long time to execute as it is blocking the cache mutation and could obviously be a performance impact. It is also important that developers understand Coherence reentrancy as the pre-events are executing on the Cache Service thread so cannot call into caches owned by the same service.

===== Receive EntryProcessorEvents for a Specific NamedMap or NamedCache

To only receive events for a specific `NamedMap` annotate the method parameter with the
link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/MapName.html[@MapName] annotation.

There are a number of different `EntryProcessorEvent` types.

* Executing - an `EntryProcessor` is being invoked on a cache, use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Executing.html[@Executing] annotation
* Executed - an `EntryProcessor` has been invoked on a cache, use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Executed.html[@Executed] annotation

To restrict the `EntryProcessorEvent` types received by a method apply one or more of the annotations above to the method parameter. For example, the method below will receive `Executed` events.

[source,java]

===== Receive EntryProcessorEvents for a Specific NamedMap or NamedCache

To only receive events for a specific `NamedMap` annotate the method parameter with the
link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/MapName.html[@MapName] annotation.
To only receive events for a specific `NamedCache` annotate the method parameter with the

==== Partition Level Transaction Events

A link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/TransactionEvent.html[TransactionEvent] is emitted in relation to all mutations in a single partition in response to executing a single request.
These are commonly referred to as partition level transactions.
For example, an `EntryProcessor` that mutates more than one entry (which could be in multiple caches) as part of a single invocation will cause a partition level transaction to occur encompassing all of those cache entries.

Transaction events are emitted by storage enabled cache services, they will only e received on the same member that the partition level transaction occurred.

To subscribe to `TransactionEvent` simply create a Spring bean with a listener method annotated with link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/CoherenceEventListener.html[@CoherenceEventListener].
The method should have a single parameter of type `TransactionEvent`.

For example, the `onEvent` method below will receive all transaction events emitted by storage enabled cache services in the same JVM.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(TransactionEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

===== Receive Specific TransactionEvent Types

There are a number of different `TransactionEvent` types.

* *Committing* - A COMMITTING event is raised prior to any updates to the underlying backing map.
This event will contain all modified entries which may span multiple backing maps. Use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Inserting.html[@Committing] annotation
* *Committed* - A COMMITTED event is raised after any mutations have been committed to the underlying backing maps.
This event will contain all modified entries which may span multiple backing maps.
Use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Inserted.html[@Committed] annotation

To restrict the `TransactionEvent` types received by a method apply one or more of the annotations above to the method parameter. For example, the method below will receive `Committed` events.

----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@Committed TransactionEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event

link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/ServiceName.html[@ServiceName] annotation.

The method below will only receive events for the caches owned by the service named `StorageService`:

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@ServiceName("StorageService") TransactionEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

==== Partition Transfer Events

A link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/TransferEvent.html[TransferEvent] captures information concerning the transfer of a partition for a storage enabled member. Transfer events are raised against the set of link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/util/BinaryEntry.html[BinaryEntry] instances that are being transferred.

NOTE: TransferEvents are dispatched to interceptors while holding a lock on the partition being transferred, blocking any operations for the partition. Event observer methods should therfore execute as quickly as possible of hand-off execution to another thread.

To subscribe to `TransferEvent` simply create a Spring bean with a listener method annotated with link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/CoherenceEventListener.html[@CoherenceEventListener].
The method should have a single parameter of type `TransferEvent`.

For example, the `onEvent` method below will receive all transaction events emitted by storage enabled cache services in the same JVM.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(TransferEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

===== Receive Specific TransferEvent Types

There are a number of different `TransferEvent` types.

* *Arrived* - This `TransferEvent` is dispatched when a set of `BinaryEntry` instances have been transferred to the link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/TransferEvent.html#getLocalMember()[local member] or restored from backup.The reason for the event (primary transfer from another member or restore from backup) can be derived as follows:

[source,java]
----
TransferEvent event;
boolean restored = event.getRemoteMember() == event.getLocalMember();
----

Use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Arrived.html[@Arrived] annotation to restrict the received events to arrived type.

* *Assigned* -  This `TransferEvent` is dispatched when a partition has been assigned to the link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/TransferEvent.html#getLocalMember()[local member]. This event will only be emitted by the ownership senior during the initial partition assignment.
Use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Assigned.html[@Assigned] annotation to restrict received events.

* *Departing* - This `TransferEvent` is dispatched when a set of `BinaryEntry` are being transferred from the link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/TransferEvent.html#getLocalMember()[local member]. This event is followed by either a `Departed` or `Rollback` event to indicate the success or failure of the transfer.
Use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Departing.html[@Departing] annotation to restrict received events.

* *Departed* - This `TransferEvent` is dispatched when a partition has been successfully transferred from the link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/TransferEvent.html#getLocalMember()[local member]. To derive the `BinaryEntry` instances associated with the transfer, consumers should subscribe to the `Departing` event that would precede this event.
Use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Departed.html[@Departed] annotation to restrict received events.

* *Lost* - This `TransferEvent` is dispatched when a partition has been orphaned (data loss _may_ have occurred), and the ownership is assumed by the link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/TransferEvent.html#getLocalMember()[local member]. This event is only be emitted by the ownership senior.
Use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Lost.html[@Lost] annotation to restrict received events.

* *Recovered* - This `TransferEvent` is dispatched when a set of `BinaryEntry` instances have been recovered from a persistent storage by the link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/TransferEvent.html#getLocalMember()[local member].
Use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Recovered.html[@Recovered] annotation to restrict received events.

* *Rollback* - This `TransferEvent` is dispatched when partition transfer has failed and was therefore rolled back. To derive the `BinaryEntry` instances associated with the failed transfer, consumers should subscribe to the `Departing` event that would precede this event.
Use the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/Rollback.html[@Rollback] annotation to restrict received events.

To restrict the `TransferEvent` types received by a method apply one or more of the annotations above to the method parameter. For example, the method below will receive `Lost` events.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@Lost TransferEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

Multiple type annotations may be used to receive multiple types of `TransferEvent`.

===== Receive TransferEvent from a Specific Cache Service

Caches are owned by a Cache Service, it is possible to restrict events received by a method to only those related to caches owned by a specific service by annotating the method parameter with the
link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/ServiceName.html[@ServiceName] annotation.

The method below will only receive events for the caches owned by the service named `StorageService`:

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(@ServiceName("StorageService") TransferEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}
----

==== Unsolicited Commit Events

An link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/net/events/partition/UnsolicitedCommitEvent.html[UnsolicitedCommitEvent] captures changes pertaining to all observed mutations performed against caches that were not directly caused (solicited) by the partitioned service. These events may be due to changes made internally by the backing map, such as eviction, or referrers of the backing map causing changes.

Unsolicited commit events are emitted by storage enabled cache services, they will only e received on the same member.

To subscribe to `UnsolicitedCommitEvent` simply create a Spring bean with a listener method annotated with link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/event/CoherenceEventListener.html[@CoherenceEventListener].
The method should have a single parameter of type `UnsolicitedCommitEvent`.

For example, the `onEvent` method below will receive all Unsolicited commit events emitted by storage enabled cache services in the same JVM.

[source,java]
----
@CoherenceEventListener
public void onEvent(UnsolicitedCommitEvent event) {
    // TODO: process the event
}

== Filter Binding Annotations

Filter binding annotations are normal annotations that are themselves annotated with the
link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/FilterBinding.html[@FilterBinding] meta-annotation.
A filter binding annotation represents a Coherence link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/util/Filter.html[Filter] and is used
to specify a `Filter` in certain injection points, for example a View (CQC), `NamedTopic` `Subscriber` beans,
event listeners, etc.

There are three parts to using a filter binding:

* The filter binding annotation
* An implementation of a link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/FilterFactory.html[FilterFactory] that
is annotated with the filter binding annotation. This is a factory that produces the required `Filter`.
* Injection points annotated with the filter binding annotation.

We will put all three parts together in an example. Let's use a Coherence `NamedMap` named `plants` that contains plants
represented by instances of the `Plant` class as map values. Among the various properties on the `Plant` class there is
a property called `plantType` and a property called `height`. In this exaple, we want to inject a view that only shows
large palm trees (any palm tree larger than 20 meters). We would need a `Filter` that has a condition like the following:
`plantType == PlantType.PALM && height >= 20`.

=== Create the filter binding annotation

First create a simple annotation, it could be called something like `PlantNameExtractor`

[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}filterbinding/LargePalmTrees.java[tags=!hide]
----
<1> The annotation class is annotated with `@FilterBinding`
<2> The annotation name is `PlantNameExtractor`

In this case the annotation does not need any other attributes.

=== Create the `FilterFactory`

Now create the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/FilterFactory.html[FilterFactory] implementation
that will produce instances of the required `Filter`.

[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}filterbinding/LargePalmTreesFilterFactory.java[tags=!hide]
----
<1> The class is annotated with the `PlantNameExtractor` filter binding annotation
<2> The class must be a Spring bean, let's annotate it with `@Component` so that component scanning will pick this class
up as a Spring bean
<3> The `create` method uses the Coherence `filters` API to create the required `filter`.

The parameter to the `create` method is the annotation used on the injection point.
In this case the annotation has no values, but if it did we could access those values to customize how the filter is created.

For example, we can make the filter more general purpose by calling the annotation `@PalmTrees` and by
adding a value parameter representing the height like this:
[source,java]
----
@FilterBinding
@Documented
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface PalmTrees {
    String value();
}
include::{include-source-code}filterbinding/PalmTrees.java[tags=!hide]
----

We then need to modify our filter factory to use the height value:

[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}filterbinding/PalmTreesFilterFactory.java[tags=!hide]
----
<1> The class is annotated with the more flexible `PalmTrees` filter binding annotation accepting a height parameter
<2> The class must be a Spring bean, let's annotate it with `@Component` so that component scanning will pick this class
up as a Spring bean
<3> The `create` method uses the Coherence `filters` API to create the required `filter`
<4> Instead of hard-coding the height, we use the value from the `@PalmTrees` annotation

=== Annotate the Injection Point

Now the application code where the view is to be injected can use the custom filter binding annotation.

[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}filterbinding/PlantService.java[tags=!hide]
----
<1> The `@View` annotation indicates that this is a view rather than a plain `NamedMap`
<2> The `@PalmTrees` annotation links to the custom filter factory which is used to create the filter for the view. The
annotation value of `1` indicates that we are interested in all palm trees of at least 1 meter in height.
<3> Due to Spring limitations regarding the injection of Maps, we use the `@NamedCache` annotation to inject the `NamedMap`,
    which also has takes an optional value to specify the name of the cache.

[[coherence-spring-extractor-binding-annotations]]
== Extractor Binding Annotations

ValueExtractor binding annotations are normal annotations that are themselves annotated with the
link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/annotation/ExtractorBinding.html[@ExtractorBinding] meta-annotation.
An extractor binding annotation represents a Coherence link:{coherence-api}com/tangosol/util/ValueExtractor.html[ValueExtractor]
and is used to specify a `ValueExtractor` in certain injection points, for example a View (CQC), `NamedTopic` `Subscriber`
beans, `MapEvent` listeners, etc.

There are three parts to using an extractor binding:

* The extractor binding annotation
* An implementation of a link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/ExtractorFactory.html[ExtractorFactory] that is annotated with the extractor binding annotation. This is a factory that produces the required `ValueExtractor`.
* Injection points annotated with the extractor binding annotation.

As an example, let's continue with our previous example, where we have a Coherence `NamedMap` named `plants` that contains
`Plant` instances as values. In this example we are interested in inject a map of plant names instead of the actual
plant instances. Each plant has a `name` property that we will use for that purpose. We will need a `ValueExtractor` that
extracts the `name` property and the resulting map of plant names can be injected into our Spring beans.

=== Create the extractor binding annotation

First create a simple annotation called `PlantName`

[source,java]
----
@ExtractorBinding                         // <1>
@Documented
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface PersonAge {            // <2>
}
include::{include-source-code}extractorbinding/PlantNameExtractor.java[tags=!hide]
----
<1> The annotation class is annotated with `@ExtractorBinding`
<2> The annotation name is `PlantNameExtractor`

In this case the annotation does not need any other attributes.

=== Create the `ExtractorFactory`

Now create the link:{coherence-spring-api}com/oracle/coherence/spring/ExtractorFactory.html[ExtractorFactory]
implementation that will produce instances of the required `ValueExtractor`.

[source,java]
----
include::{include-source-code}extractorbinding/PlantNameExtractorFactory.java[tags=!hide]
----
<1> The class is annotated with the `PlantNameExtractor` extractor binding annotation
<2> The class must be a Spring bean, let's annotate it with `@Component` so that component scanning will pick this class
up as a Spring bean
<3> The `create` method uses the Coherence `Extractors` API to create the required extractor, in this case a trivial property extractor.

The parameter to the `create` method is the annotation used on the injection point.
In this case the annotation has no values, but if it did we could access those values to customize how the `ValueExtractor` is created.

=== Annotate the Injection Point

Now the application code where the view is to be injected can use the custom extractor binding annotation.

[source,java]
----
@View               // <1>
@PersonAge          // <2>
@Name("people")     // <3>
private NamedMap<String, Integer> ages;   // <4>
include::{include-source-code}extractorbinding/PlantService.java[tags=!hide]
----
<1> The `@View` annotation indicates that this is a view rather than a plain `NamedMap`
<2> The `@PlantNameExtractor` annotation links to the custom extractor factory used to create the `ValueExtractor` for the view
<3> Due to Spring limitations regarding the injection of Maps, we use the `@NamedCache` annotation to inject the `NamedMap`,
which also has takes an optional value to specify the underlying cache/map name to use for the view.
<4> Note that the `NamedMap` generics are now `Long` and `String` instead of `Long` and `Plant` as the `Plant` values
from the underlying cache are transformed into `String` values by extracting just the name property.
